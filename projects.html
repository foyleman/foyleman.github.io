It was an interesting coincidence that my mother experienced a stroke during development and I found the information to be quite useful in my understanding of the drug and my mother’s condition. This application was primarily an interactive video that had scripted points within the video that allowed the viewer to drag the drug through the arteries or other interesting places and get a better understanding of how it works within the body. This was a great implementation of producing what felt like an interactive video to the user apply seamless transitions between real video and interactive elements.</span>

										<span class="project-pages">When I started making websites in the early 2000’s I was either programming straight HTML or trying to work with PHPNuke. PHPNuke was a popular Content Management System modular in design allowing customization and drop-in functionality. The more I used this CMS, the more I understood it’s inner-workings… and the less I enjoyed feeling stuck with whatever they had developed.

My solution was to create my own CMS. Using PHP and MySQL as the base, I developed a completely modular CMS. With extra security layers, I am proud to say it hasn’t been broken in the more than 10 years it’s been online. I’ve had the honor of developing over 100 modules for myself and my clients.</span>

I took these lessons and used them to develop my own stand alone application for sending out bulk emails.

A few years later, I threw in all the bells and whistles and created a system that could stand up to Constant Contact. However, without the infrastructure of a large workforce behind us, we offered it to large corporations as a brand-able product to use in-house.</span>
